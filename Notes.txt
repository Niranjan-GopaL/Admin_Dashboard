Remember:
1)  In order to understand the different tech used, go to the start of the video 
    where he explains about the project, it's functionalities and why it is better
    than mui, chakra, etc. 

2)  Learn from docs and tutorials of syncfusion
3)  LEARN TAILWIND WHEN YOU GO OVER IT AGAIN: 
    ->  Tailwind CSS Intellisense vs extension , so now on hovering over tailwind CSS class
        you can see it's css version
    ->  Have tailwind doc open and PASTE the className and LEARN ONLY THOSE 
        THAT YOU USED HERE

4) creating all the components' files (populating components with ALL THE 
    COMPONENTS' boilerplate {just doing rafce}) and exporting it all from a common index.js 
    This will make it SOO MUCH MORE EASIER in the future

5)

Progress

Added Data folder which has all the img, dummy data, etc



Before you get into building again, progress till now:
in components , index.jsx was given but I made it index.js will it push error?
