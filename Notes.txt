Scope For improvment --------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  The User Profile is just a static image. His name too.
    You can furthur this project by attaching a backend for users' data.
    And User's space in Navabr to be according to the user that is using the website ,which we'll get from back end

2)  Login/SignUp and Authentication , Forgot password , Reset Password Integration

3)  Make the revenue section wayy better , you can change the idea itself

Remember:
1)  In order to understand the different tech used, go to the start of the video 
    where he explains about the project, it's functionalities and why it is better
    than mui, chakra, etc. 

2)  Learn from docs and tutorials of syncfusion
3)  LEARN TAILWIND WHEN YOU GO OVER IT AGAIN: 
    ->  Tailwind CSS Intellisense vs extension , so now on hovering over tailwind CSS class
        you can see it's css version
    ->  Have tailwind doc open and PASTE the className and LEARN ONLY THOSE 
        THAT YOU USED HERE

4)  creating all the components' files (populating components with ALL THE 
    COMPONENTS' boilerplate {just doing rafce}) and exporting it all from a common index.js 
    This will make it SOO MUCH MORE EASIER in the future

5)  Then you create the components you need one by one 

6)  ContextProvider , States , Hooks are very important. Learn that and improve this project TO ANOTHER LEAGUE

7)  ALL ICONS ARE FROM react-icons. So now you know react-icons , material icons . etc



PROGRESS LOGS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

Added Data folder which has all the img, dummy data, etc
Sidebar and ContextProvider over 
But GO OVER IT AGAIN


Before you get into building again, progress till now:
1)  in components , index.jsx was given but I made it index.js will it push error?
2)  the cross-icon to close sidebar is not styled completely, it vanishes if you style fully
    pain pecko , sigh
3)  Both the Ecommerce page (Revenue section in Vid, they finished making the 4 cards , now onto charts now)
    and Data tables are being designed


---

5)  Setting up Routes for entire thing

6)  First we dedigned the Sidebar

7)  -ContextProvider.js where we dictate all the states for the entire application.
    -Wrapping app in index.js with ContectProvider
ReactDOM.render(
    <ContextProvider>
        <App />
    </ContextProvider>
,document.getElementById('root'));

    -Using it AS A HOOK in App.jsx and wherever we need to know state.
    Eg :- In Sidebar :-
On clicking the Link it'll call setActiveMenu function and pass it false
<Link to="/" onClick={() =>() } className="...">------------ 
changing this to                                           |
                                                        |
                                                        '
<Link to="/" onClick={() => setActiveMenu(false)} className=".."
     In some cases we want to do something based on previous state , (above we are passing false) 
     There we'll use :-
<button type="button" onClick={() => setActiveMenu(!activeMenu) }  className=".." > 
    Actuall code setActiveMenu calls a callback function :-
    <button type="button" onClick={() => setActiveMenu( (prevActiveMenu)  => !prevActiveMenu)}

    - FYI :useState snippets appear in Intellisense


8)  Designing Navbar

    - In order to make the Sidebar 'appear' , you'll need to press a button on Navbar. 
    - The small down arrow is also from React icons. DAMNNN. Remember what all we can get from react-icons

9)  Designing First page on the sidebar :- ECOMMERCE

Interesting part :- 
    Designed Button component. (does syncfusion not have a button ? ans- Not suited to our needs)
    This would design a button based on the parameters passed


        IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT COLOR THEME. UNDERSTAND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT .

        This is might be how:- 
        This button's style is given dynamically. the `item.iconColor`
            <button
                type="button"
                style={{ color: item.iconColor, backgroundColor: item.iconBg }}
                className="text-2xl opacity-0.9 rounded-full  p-4 hover:drop-shadow-xl"
              >
